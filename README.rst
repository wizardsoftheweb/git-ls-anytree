Until ``v1``, this branch won't be updated often. Check out the ``dev`` (`source <https://github.com/wizardsoftheweb/git-ls-anytree/tree/dev>`__) branch or the `tags <https://github.com/wizardsoftheweb/git-ls-anytree/tags>`__ for active code.

As it turns out, embedding an inline literal inside a link is impossible using basic configuration and easily accessible SO results. So, rather than being able to duplicate Markdown links:

::

    [`.editorconfig`](source <http://editorconfig.org/)

I have to print the literal followed by the link

::

    ``.editorconfig``: `source <http://editorconfig.org/>`__

(Don't get me started on trying to inline an inline literal.)
